# ObjectDetectionOnCommand
Object Detection with transfer learning
## Project Overview

Welcome to Seyeon's Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Capstone project in the AI Nanodegree! This project will explore how to detect different objects in a real-time video and follow voice commands provided by users.


## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
```	
git clone https://github.com/SeyeonLee/VoiceAssistedCamera.git
cd vac
```

2. Download the [PASCAL VOC 2012 Training/Validation Data](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/index.html#devkit). Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/vac/Images/train` and `path/to/vac/Images/valid`.
	- __Linux__: 
  	If you are using a Linux machine, you can refer to the website below.
  	https://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-open-a-tar-file-in-unix-or-linux/
  
  		- From the terminal, change to the directory where yourfile.tar has been downloaded.
 		- Type tar -xvf yourfile.tar to extract the file to the current directory.
  		- Or tar -C /myfolder -xvf yourfile.tar to extract to another directory
  
	- __Mac__: 
	Mac authomatically unzips .tar files.
  
	- __Windows__:  
	If you are using a Windows machine, you can use [WinZip](https://www.winzip.com/win/en/tar-file.html) to extract the folder.

3. Download the [PASCAL VOC 2012 Testing Data](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/index.html#testdata).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/vac/Images/test`.
